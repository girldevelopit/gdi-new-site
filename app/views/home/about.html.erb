      <p class="large">“Girl, Develop It!” began as a call to action for women, by women who were tired of the low representation of women in tech, and wanted to make a difference. The organization was founded in New York City in 2010 by <%= link_to("Vanessa Hurst", "http://vanessahurst.com/") %> and <%= link_to("Sara Chipps", "http://sarajchipps.com/") %>. Today, Girl Develop It chapters are building strong, empowered communities in 46 cities, representing 35,000+ members nationwide who are changing their lives through learning to code with us.</p>
