      be!  I understand that sometimes it can be intimidating for women to be in the

    bio: <p>Carl grew up squarely in the rust belt where he started programming on
      his Atari 800. When he's not cooking food for Girl Develop It members, he helps
      manage a horse farm and performs some sort of mysterious, complicated job at
      Nationwide Insurance. You can stop by his house anytime for a ridiculous home
      cooked meal - although if you're vegan or gluten-free that kinda cramps his
      style because he puts butter, heavy cream and flour in everything. In his free
      time, Carl likes to promote science and critical thinking, advocate for the
      rights of all people, bake, play with his kitten, and write bios in the third
      person. He promises a big teary-eyed hug to anyone who actually recognizes what
      his twitter handle means (as long as you're cool with hugs because he realizes
      not everybody is).</p>

      doesn't have to be a boys club and I want to empower women to fully embrace
      it. Even if not their primary passion, technology is so pervasive today that
      equipping women with basic knowledge of how it works can only serve to benefit.
      I have a passion for volunteering and trying to help others where I can, and
